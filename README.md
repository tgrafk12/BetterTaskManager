BetterTaskManager README

BTM is a small project that is dedicated to making a lightweight System Utilization graph display for users to see on another monitor or overlayed when using their PC. This application will be able to display system information updated in near realtime. 
This program will have some appearance options, like Dark Mode and Transparency can further help users for Accessibility or ease of use while using your PC. 

  BTM is managed by tgrafk12, a VERY low skilled developer, MOST of the code you see here developed in this project is written by an AI. If you know of better ways to make my life easier and more focused, please HMU on Discord (fadedquill7)

Asking to Comit to our project would be as helpful as adding butter to toast. *It just makes it SO MUCH BETTER.* My goal is a community project that can be easily edited by many developers and have more power to the Daily PC User. 

    ELUA: Using my code, you agree to report any bugs or issues you come across. Reporting anything to (fadedquill7) or taking the time to write a Comit or Issue with my code would be greatly appreciated. Using my code in your projects also means to credit its Author if used. 

Any Questions? Ask away! :)
